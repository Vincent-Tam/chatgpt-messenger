# Chatgpt Messenger | [Demo](https://vincent-chatgpt-messenger.vercel.app/)

This is a clone of the official chatgpt client side. The website developed with [Next.js (v13)](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Reminder

Because the website implemented Google authentication by the Firebase.
Therefore, the website requires **Google Login** and will store all messages in the Firebase.
